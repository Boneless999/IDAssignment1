Your Project's Name

My project is about doing a website for a classical band. It consists of a total of 4 pages, the Home page, About Us page, Upcoming Performance page and the Conatct Us page. The Home page contains 
a navigation bar to other pages and also a Welcome in the middle of the page. It is mainly used to navigate to other pages where there is more content and information. Secondly, it is the About us page which contains a picture of the classical band, audio of past performances of the band and a timeline of where the band performed at in the past. Next is the page about the upcoming performances. The
page includes a poster about the performace and details beside it such as the location and timing of the show. Last but not least is the Contact Us page which allow the user to enter some information such as their name and contact number.

Design Process

This website would be for fans of this classical band or some people who wants to know more about this band. This website allow the user to stay updated on some of the upcoming performance of the band, thus allowing them to purchase the tickets as fast as possible. For people who wants to know more about this band, they can explore the "About Us" page whoch contains a picture of them and a short introduction beside it. It also showcases the audio of some of the past performaces and also some of the places where they performed before. People can also go to their social media pages to know more about them
